WELCOME!

This is a simple blog created with node, express, sequalizejs, and d3. In order to see it in action, I've included data in the SQL tables.

The bubble chart in the media section is based on this code:  http://vallandingham.me/bubble_charts_in_d3.html

Passwords and all customizable aspects of the code can be found & changed in the config file.
