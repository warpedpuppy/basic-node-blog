This is a simple blog created with node, express, sequalizejs, and d3. In order to see it in action, I've included data in the SQL tables.

The bubble chart in the media section is based on this code:  http://vallandingham.me/bubble_charts_in_d3.html

The password to get into the login section is "asdf".  This and all customizable aspects of the code can be found in the config file.
